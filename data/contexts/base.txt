    also cover those costs which the insured person incurs
    in taking appropriate measures to prevent this loss.
    
    **101.3 Gross negligence coverage**
    
    If additionally agreed in the policy, Zurich shall dispense
    with exercising its right of recovery against the insured
    if the occurrence of loss is caused as a result of gross
    negligence. However, Zurich shall exercise its right of
    recovery against the insured if the damage:
    
- Is caused when in a state of inebriation or when unfit
to drive or
- Due to particularly flagrant disregard of the speed limit,
hazardous overtaking or participation in an illegal race
with motor vehicles pursuant to Article 90, paragraph 3
Swiss Road Traffic Act (RTA).

**Art. 15
Economic, trade and financial sanctions**

Zurich does not provide coverage and is not obliged to
make payments or provide benefits or services if applica-
ble economic, trade and financial sanctions would be
violated.

When exercising its right of recovery the severity of the
negligence and the financial circumstances of the person
against whom the right of recovery is exercised will be
taken into account.

**Art. 102
Insured persons**

The insurance covers the policyholder, the owner and
the persons for whom the owner is responsible under
the road traffic legislation.

**Art. 103
Insurance benefits**

Zurich shall pay justified claims and protect the insured
against unjustified claims.

The benefits payable by Zurich shall be limited to 100 mil-
lion CHF per event, including any interest on the loss or
damage, lawyers’ fees and court costs.

The amount of the benefits payable for any bodily injury
and property damage caused by fire, explosion or nuclear
energy, as well as for the cost of loss prevention measures
shall be limited to a total of 5 million CHF per occurrence
of loss – subject to Art. 104.7.

Where the Swiss road traffic legislation provides for higher
guarantee, this shall apply and is deemed the maximum
benefit payable by Zurich.

Exclusions**

No insurance coverage is provided for:

**104.1 Property damage**

Claims due to property damage suffered by the owner,
damage to the insured vehicle or trailer, as well as damage

luggage and similar effects;

**104.2 Races and similar rides**

Claims arising from accidents at races, rallies and similar
competitions, as well as all rides on racetracks including
associated secondary tracks. However, in the case of
events of this type within Switzerland and/or in the Prin-
cipality of Liechtenstein, third-party claims within the
meaning of Art.72, para.4 of the Swiss Road Traffic Act
are only excluded if the event in question is covered

by the compulsory statutory insurance;

Scope of insurance**

**201.1 Vehicle**

The insurance covers damage caused against the policy-
holder’s will to the declared vehicle as well as to spare
parts, equipment and accessories.

**201.2 Equipment and accessories**

In the case of passenger cars, vans, motorcycles and
motorhomes, equipment and accessories which do not
form part of the standard equipment and which are
purchased at extra charge are also insured for up to 10%
of the catalog price – without any special agreement.

In the case of all other motor vehicles, extras and special
equipment are only included in the insurance if they are
declared at their replacement cost in the application/offer.
If these values and/or the catalog price are declared at

an amount that is too low, the insurance benefits shall be
reduced proportionally.

The insurance does not cover accessories that can also
be used independently of the vehicle.

**104.6 Criminal offences**

Claims arising from accidents in connection with the
intentional or attempted commission of criminal offences
and misdemeanors;

**104.7 Nuclear energy**

Claims arising out of damage for which liability is subject
to the legislation on nuclear energy.

**Art. 105
Rights of recovery**

The legal provisions give the injured party the right to
make his/her claims directly against Zurich. For this reason,
the exclusions under

- Art. 104.3 Unlawful trips,
• Art. 104.4 Unauthorized trips,
• Art. 104.5 Joy rides,
• Art. 104.6 Criminal offences

cannot be held against the injured party.

If legal or contractual reasons limit the insurance coverage
(e. g. trips in a state of inebriation) or annul the insurance
coverage (e. g. trips without the legally required driver’s
license), Zurich may demand the return of part or all of the
costs it has incurred from the insured. Likewise, Zurich
may demand the return of the costs it has incurred if it has
to render benefits although the insurance has already
expired.

**Art. 202
Insured events**

Depending on what is agreed, insurance coverage
includes the following events of collision and partial
casco, together they constitute a comprehensive cover:

**202.1 Collision**

The insurance covers damage caused by sudden and vio-
lent external means, e.g.in particular damage caused by
impact, collision, rollover, falling, or sinking in, even if such
damage is the consequence of damage due to the opera-
tion of the vehicle, breakage or wear and tear; likewise,
damage caused by willful acts of third parties.

Coverage shall further include alignment damage to the
vehicle as a result of tilting, loading or offloading opera-
tions even without external causes. Insurance coverage is
conditional upon compliance with operating and safety
regulations during dumping, loading and unloading, and
safety systems may not be bypassed or switched off.

Collision damage to tires only is not insured.

**202.2 Coverage for gross negligence**

If the collision damage is caused due to gross negligence,
Zurich will not reduce the benefits.

However, if the damage is caused while under the influ-
ence of alcohol or while being unfit to drive, without
this being a case of the type described in Art.204.6, the
benefits shall be reduced depending on the gravity

of the fault.

**202.3 Partial casco**

a) Theft

The insurance covers the loss, destruction of or damage to
the vehicle as a result of theft, use without permission
(even through car-hacking) or robbery in terms of criminal
law. This list is exhaustive and conclusive.

The insurance also covers damage to the vehicle due
to attempted theft, attempted use without permission
or attempted robbery.

Use without permission by persons living in the same
household as the policyholder is not considered to be
loss or damage resulting from theft.

b) Fire

The insurance covers damage to the vehicle caused
by fire, explosion, lightning, short circuits and fire extin-
guishing activities.

Singeing damage, however, is not insured.

Damage to electronic and electrical appliances and com-

internal defect.

During the period of warranty fire damage is only insured
if no claims can be made under the warranty.

c) Natural hazards

The insurance covers loss or damage as a direct conse-
quence of:

- Storm (= wind of a velocity of at least 75 km/h), hail,

    d) Glass
    
    The insurance covers loss or damage due to breakage
    of the windshield, side, roof and rear windows made
    of glass or other materials used as a glass substitute.
    The list is exhaustive and conclusive.
    
    Glass PLUS
    
    If Glass PLUS has been agreed, in addition, the insurance
    covers loss or damage due to breakage of all vehicle
    parts made of glass or materials used as glass substitutes.
    Light bulbs are also included in the insurance if they are
    destroyed in the event of glass breakage.
    

The scope of coverage for motorcycles corresponds
to the Glass PLUS option.

No indemnity will be paid under Glass or Glass PLUS if
the total repair costs (costs of glass and other repair costs)
reach the replacement value of the declared vehicle or
if the damaged vehicle components cannot be replaced
or repaired.

e) Animals

The insurance covers damage caused by collisions
between the declared vehicle and animals. Damage

or rodents.

h) Parking damage

Coverage extends to damage to the declared vehicle while
it is parked, caused by unknown vehicles or persons.
There is a limit of two events of a loss per calendar year;
the date when the Policyholder reports the claim to Zurich
is decisive. The insurance benefits shall be limited to

the specified sum insured in the policy. If, in the event of
a loss, benefits are provided simultaneously under the
collision accidental damage insurance, no further or addi-
tional claim may be asserted under the parking damage
insurance.

Parking damage PLUS

If Parking damage PLUS insurance has been agreed,
the amount is not limited.

i) Items transported in the vehicle

Insurance coverage exists if the transported items of
the passengers/users:

- Are damaged at the same time as the declared vehicle,
- Are stolen through the violent opening of the completely
locked vehicle or theft-proof containers attached to
the vehicle.

Sound, image and data carriers, computer hardware and

The insured person is obligated to keep systems and
programs technologically up-to-date or comply with the
recommendations for the manufacturer’s official software,

by third parties and install new software releases and pub-
lished updates.

    rior of the vehicle. The insurance benefits are limited to
    the sum insured specified in the policy. A maximum of one
    event of a loss will be paid per calendar year; the date
    when the Policyholder reports the claim to Zurich is deci-
    sive.
    

The following are not insured:

If, in the event of a loss, other benefits are provided under
the accidental damage insurance, no further or additional
claim may be asserted under the interior coverage.

l) Rim and tire protection

Insurance coverage applies exclusively to rims and tires
that were permanently attached to the vehicle at the time
of the damage.

ences is insured.

The insurance covers damage to tires caused by:

- Penetration of nails, screws, broken glass or other sharp
objects on the road,
- Hitting or driving into curbs,
- Spontaneous tire bursting without direct external influ-
ences.
    
    This list is conclusive.
    
    If rims or tires are damaged, Zurich will pay for the costs
    of the repairs, albeit up to a maximum of the amount
    required for the replacement of the damaged rim or tire
    at the time of the occurrence of loss.
    
    If the repair costs exceed the replacement costs, the latter
    will be reimbursed.
    
    In the case of tire replacement, Zurich will also pay the
    costs for tire removal and fitting, balancing and disposal.
    
    The insurance benefits per event are limited to the sum
    insured specified in the policy. A maximum of one event
    of a loss will be paid per calendar year; the date when
    the Policyholder reports the claim to Zurich is decisive.
    
    No compensation will be paid if the damaged rim or tire
    is not replaced or repaired.
    
    The following are not insured:
    
    - Punctures, if the damaged tire does not have the mini-
    mum tread depth of 3 mm,
    - Damage caused by a tire pressure that deviates from

    asserted under the rims and tires protection.

The insurance covers the theft of and damage to the pro-
tective clothing of the driver of the insured motorcycle
and of any passengers.

Protective clothing includes helmets, motorcycle suits
including protectors, safety suits, boots and gloves.
This list is exhaustive and conclusive.

Insurance coverage extends to:

- Damage or destruction that is directly related to an acci-
dent involving the motorcycle being used; purely optical
damage that does not impair the protective effect of the
clothing is not insured;
- Theft, provided that the items insured are in fully locked
containers (storage area/storage compartment) firmly
attached to the motorcycle and secured against theft;
the theft of helmets is also insured if they are secured
to the motorcycle with a helmet lock.
    
    In addition, insurance coverage includes the Policyholder
    and/or persons living in the same household if they are
    the drivers or passengers of any motorcycle.
    
    **Art. 203
    Insurance benefits**
    
    **203.1 Partial loss**
    
    If the vehicle is damaged through an insured event, Zurich
    shall pay the reasonable costs of repair, taking into consid-
    eration the condition and age of the vehicle.
    
    Policyholders may use the repair shop of their choice.
    However, this does not apply where Help Point PLUS has
    been agreed. If Zurich cannot reach an agreement with
    the repair shop commissioned by the Policyholder con-
    cerning the proposed cost estimate, Zurich reserves the
    right to obtain an additional quote from a recognized
    
    and reputable repair shop and to discharge its obligation
    by paying the estimated costs to the Policyholder.
    
    If lack of maintenance, wear and tear or preexisting dam-
    age has substantially increased the costs of repair
    or if the repair has substantially improved the condition
    of the vehicle, the Policyholder shall bear a reasonable
    portion of these costs.
    
    Tires shall be indemnified on the basis of their degree
    of wear. Art. 202.3 l) remains reserved.
    
    If the claimant is entitled to pre-tax deductions, the
    value-added tax component shall be deducted.
    
    If payment is made without any repairs being carried out,
    the calculated repair costs shall be reimbursed exclusive
    of VAT.
    
    **203.2 Total loss**
    
    Zurich shall pay benefits according to the compensation
    table below if:
    
    - The costs of repair in the first two years amount to at
    least 65% of the indemnity listed in the basis table below,
- The costs of repair reach at least the replacement value
after more than two years of service,
- The vehicle that has been used without permission is
not recovered within 30 days of Zurich receiving notifica-
tion of the theft.

If purchase price protection is included in the policy,
Zurich shall provide compensation to a maximum of the
purchase price paid for five years from the purchase date.

The replacement value is the amount that would have to
be paid on the date of the loss or damage in order to
purchase a similar vehicle of equivalent value on the open
market. If no agreement can be reached regarding the
replacement value, the valuation guidelines for road vehi-
cles and trailers of the Swiss Association of Neutral
Freelance Vehicle Loss Adjusters (vffs) shall apply.

If the indemnity is higher than the price that was paid for
the vehicle, only the price paid shall be reimbursed,
but this shall be no less than the replacement value. If the
replacement value is higher than the original new value,
the latter shall be the maximum indemnity.

Preexisting, but unrepaired damage shall be deducted
from the indemnity.

The benefit shall always be reduced by the value of the
unrepaired vehicle or accessories. If this amount is not
deducted from the maximum liability, the wreck shall
become the property of Zurich when payment is made.

These conditions shall apply accordingly to individual
items of equipment and accessories, excluding tires.

If the claimant is entitled to deduct input tax, the val-
ue-added tax component shall be deducted.

**203.3 Costs**

In the occurrence of an insured loss event, Zurich
shall pay the cost of:

- Recovering and towing the vehicle to the nearest
suitable garage;
- Damage to the interior of the car caused while
rendering assistance to accident victims;

– If the vehicle can be returned by the Policyholder,
the owner or the driver;

– If other third parties are liable for the costs;
• The customs duty.

**203.4 Indemnity in the event of the theft of the vehicle**

If a vehicle that has been taken without permission is
recovered within 30 days of Zurich receiving notification
of the theft, Zurich will bear the costs of any necessary
repair, except in the case of a total loss.

**203.5 Items being transported and protective clothing**

Zurich shall pay the costs of repair, but no more than the
following amounts:

- In the case of items being transported the amount
necessary in order to purchase an item of equivalent
value at the time of the occurrence of loss. The maxi-
mum liability shall be reduced by the residual value;
- In the case of protective clothing in the first two years
after purchase of the new item, the amount necessary
to purchase a new item of equivalent value at the time
of the occurrence of loss; after that the indemnity will be
reduced to 75% of the actual price of replacing the item.
    
    The insurance benefits shall be limited to the specified
    sum insured in the policy.
    
    The stolen or damaged items shall become the property
    of Zurich once payment has been made.
    
    If stolen items are subsequently recovered, the indemnity,
    less a lump sum for any reduction in value, shall be repaid
    to Zurich, or the items placed at Zurich’s disposal.
    
    **203.6 Motorized mobile homes and campers/trailers**
    
    The costs of repair will only be indemnified if the damage
    is fully repaired and proof of repair can be provided in the
    form of an invoice. If no repairs are carried out, the benefits
    shall be limited to the vehicle’s loss in value.
    
    **203.7 Reduction of benefits**
    
    Zurich shall be entitled to reduce or refuse benefits insofar
    as it is entitled to do so under the Swiss Federal Law on
    Insurance Contracts (VVG/LIC).
    
    If the insured event has been caused through gross negli-
    gence or intent by someone living in the same household
    as the Policyholder or claimant, Zurich reserves the right
    to reduce or refuse benefits to the amount that would
    
    be payable if the damage had been caused by the Policy-
    holder or the claimant.
    
    **Art. 204
